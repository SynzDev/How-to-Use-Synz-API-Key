# How To Use My API Key!
What is my api key for? Well my api keys are for all my nodejs packages!
But you may ask how does one get this key! Well its simple just dm Synz#3471 on Discord.

# Where do i put this key?
The exact use for each package is roughly the same but there will be a option like
```js
authKey: "--- API KEY HERE ---",
```
and you just change that to the key you purchased from Synz!

# Why do i need a API key?
Well the main reason for the api key is so i can make a bit of money back for the time i have
invested in these packages that are made to make your life easier!

# Can i buy a bot with a key?
Yes you can indeed! When purchasing a Discord bot from my server https://discord.gg/t8s2zq6rTM
the bot price includes a api key if you have requested certain features!

# Can i buy a bot without the key?
Yes, you can buy a bot without the key but we cant guarantee that you will receive the quality of the 
packages that use the API :<
